## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

- **1.	Japanese public attitude and interest in Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination: social media analysis (in progress)**
    - Japan is experiencing an HPV vaccine crisis, starting with a rapid decline in the vaccination rate in 2013 from approximately 70% to less than 1% and lasting until now.
    - Aim to understand public stances and health information-seeking behaviors by Google Trends and Twitter analysis.
    - Subproject 1: Google Trends analysis of cervical cancer, HPV vaccines, and cervical screening between 2004 and 2021.
    - Subproject 2: Japanese tweets analysis of public stances towards HPV vaccination between 2011 and 2021 based on deep learning approaches. 
    - Subproject 3: Profile and community analysis of Japanese Twitter users with different stances towards HPV vaccination.
- **2.	Predicting infectious diseases in Japan using Google Trends data (in progress)**
    - Traditional report systems for infectious diseases delay one or several weeks, but Internet searching data can be updated in approximately real-time. 
    - Searching data has potential value in reporting infectious cases combined with mobility data.
    - Aim to discover the relationship between information-seeking behaviors and various infectious diseases, and their affection by COVID-19 pandemic.
- **3.	Public opinions and sentiments of COVID-19 vaccination in Japan (completed)**
    - COVID-19 vaccination in Japan lagged behind other developed countries but reached the vaccination rate of 70% within several months, although vaccine confidence in Japan is the lowest worldwide.
    - Japanese tweets were analyzed using statistical and machine learning methods to elaborate opinions and sentiments and determine the reasons for rapid vaccination rate.
    - Negative sentiment overwhelmed positive sentiment along with some key events. But after the large-scale rollout around May 2021, vaccination rate rapidly increased. Fear of infection and efficient delivery of vaccine reservation information might contribute to the rapid vaccination rate in Japan, although fear of side effects of vaccines overwhelmed infection at the beginning of vaccination. No evidence for increased vaccine confidence was observed in our work. 
- **4.	Health effects of immediate telework introduction in Japan (completed)**
    - Surveyed more than 5,000 workers about their health effects under different work conditions during emergency statements.
    - We found facing the immediate change of work style; teleworkers experienced more mental health, work-family conflict, physical issues, and unhealthy lifestyle.
